# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This repository showcases my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) practice on multiple datasets, focusing on understanding data distribution, cleaning, transformation, and visualization for better insights and model readiness.

📋 Overview

The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of datasets using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
The EDA process includes identifying trends, missing values, outliers, correlations, and relationships between key variables.

This repository demonstrates how data can be converted into meaningful insights through analytical and visualization techniques.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

🔍 EDA Workflow

The analysis process follows a structured approach:

Importing Libraries & Dataset
Load all essential libraries and read the dataset (CSV or Excel).

Initial Data Inspection

Check the dataset’s structure and shape

Identify datatypes, unique values, and duplicates

Data Cleaning

Handle missing and null values

Remove duplicates

Correct inconsistent data formats

Exploratory Analysis

Statistical summary (.describe(), .info())

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Correlation heatmaps and pair plots

Data Visualization
Visualize data patterns using:

Histograms / Boxplots (for distribution and outliers)

Bar plots / Count plots (for categorical data)

Heatmaps / Pair plots (for correlation analysis)

Insights & Conclusions

Identify trends, relationships, and data patterns

Highlight potential predictive variables

Suggest possible business or research insights
